## 🚀 Just Completed My Text-to-Video Generation Project using Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion + ZeroScope model! 🎥✨

In this exciting deep learning project, I brought imagination to motion by 
converting text prompts directly into short video clips using:

## 🔹 Hugging Face Diffusers
 🔹 ZeroScope v2 576w for high-quality generation
 🔹 PyTorch, Streamlit, and ImageIO for processing and deployment
 🔹 Ngrok for public app access

## 🛠 Key Features I Built:
 ✅ Interactive Streamlit Web App
 ✅ Customizable settings: frame count, resolution, FPS
 ✅ Real-time video generation from any creative prompt
 ✅ Downloadable video output
 ✅ Fully GPU-accelerated pipeline

💡 Prompt Example: “A Cat Play with Ball ...” → turned into a dynamic, realistic short video.
 Yes, it’s that magical! 🪄
🎯 This project reflects my growing interest in Generative AI, Diffusion Models, and AI-powered multimedia applications.
